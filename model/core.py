-------
Central driver for the IAEA TECDOC-643 Appendix A-2 Generic 10 MW LEU
Research Reactor OpenMC model.

Single control surface: edit CoreConfig (or use the CLI) — everything else
(materials, geometry, settings, tallies) is assembled by build_model() so
every run goes through one code path with tallies attached.

CLI examples (from the repo root, conda env `openmc-env`):
    python model/core.py                               # defaults (all-in)
    python model/core.py --insertion 0 --particles 50000 --batches 150
    python model/core.py --insertion 68.5 --output-dir run_results/crit_search

BLADE DIRECTION CONVENTION (read this before touching insertion logic):
    CoreConfig.blade_insertion_percent is the INTUITIVE control-room sense:
        0   = blades fully WITHDRAWN  (core most reactive)
        100 = blades fully INSERTED   (absorber spans the active fuel)
    geometry.build_core_geometry() takes a WITHDRAWAL fraction f:
        f = 0.0 fully INSERTED, f = 1.0 fully WITHDRAWN
    build_model() converts: f_withdrawal = 1.0 - blade_insertion_percent/100.
